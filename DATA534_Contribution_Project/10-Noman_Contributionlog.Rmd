# Hi Noman here 

This includes Noman's contribution into developing an API wrapper utilising OpenAI and Indeed APIs.

## 01-Intro

All chapter sections start with a second-level (`##`) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter.

### An unnumbered section {-}

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a `{.unnumbered}` or the shorter `{-}` at the end of the heading, like in this section.
